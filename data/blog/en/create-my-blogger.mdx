# To My First Blog:

# Origin

I have been thinking about myself. Feeling that I've wasted a lot of time in the past doing nothing important.
But as I look back throughly, I found that I have been doing something that I really like.
Beyond the talk of myself, I would still don't know where to start with.

Therefore, I set up this website. Just to record and make myself remember what I have done and what I am planning to do.

# Objectives

- To record my life
- To record my thoughts
- To record my plans
- To write some tutorials

After all, the resources and information about coding and technologies in Taiwan is really less.

# Structure about this website

I build this website with [Next.js 13](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-13), decorated with [tailwind.css](https://tailwindcss.com), and hosted with [Oracle Cloud](https://cloud.oracle.com) and [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com) with heart.
But I am not the one who wrote all of this things. The structure is build by [timlrx](https://github.com/timlrx) with repository [nextjs-started-blog](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog).
Wait for my avaliable time, I will rewrite the code and write a tutorial about how to build a website like this.

# Todo List

- [ ] Add multi-language support
- [ ] Change the theme
- [ ] Write a tutorial
