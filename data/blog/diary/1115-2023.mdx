# Diary of 2023 week 10 in NYCU

It is terrible that I became the leader of christmas party in NYCU.
I have no related experience in this activity.
Every day I woke up these days, I felt like I've got a lot of things to do. So stressful!
Hopefully, this life wouldn't last forever. I would have a lot of time to relieve after December 8th.

Sad stories that only 10 weeks past in this semester, we broke up with our rootmate.
It is so awkward that we still have to live together for 5 more months.
I hope we can get used to this situation as soon as possible. (Maybe?)

## About my acadamic

It is a lot of fun to have so many different class this semseter.
Python machine learning is the one with most excitment.
There are so many things to learn in this class.
Though, I can spare really little time to study.
The main role for me in this class is to shot video description for the project.

But for chemistry, I messed up the first exam.
To be more specific, I didn't even know there was an exam.
Then I skipped it. what a bad student I am.

And, today I just knew that I would have to take a test for statistics next monday.
I have no idea what I should do now.
So Bad!!!

I thought I would have enough time to catch up with my homework for Operations Reserch this weekend.
But I was wrong. I have to take the statistics test next monday.

## Plannings

There are only 6 weeks left this semester.
And christmas party is hold on December 8th.(week 13)
Hope that I could finish both sides gracefully.

As for chemistry, I would definitely withdraw from this class.
